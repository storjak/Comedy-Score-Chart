    Currently implementing channels and the ability to automatically add and remove rooms with socket.io.  Also needs a method to limit Twitch API requests, and will start a temporary local database with key pairs of channel id's to channel names to reduce total requests.

    Also does not yet detect channel live status, which will affect if the chart activates at all.  However, seeing as extensions normally aren't visible on an offline channel, this may not be an issue.
